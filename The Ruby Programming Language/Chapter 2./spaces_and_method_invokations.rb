f(3+2)+1
f (3+2)+1
# Two different ways to invoke a method...
# The first way is calling f with the argument 5
# The second way is calling f with the argument 6 because the entire second expression is considered the arguement for function f
=begin Some notes....
So...
Never put a space after the function name and before the first argument.
If the first argument to a method begins wiht an open parenthesis, always use the parentheses in the method invokation.
Always run the Ruby interpreter with the -w option.
